### 🛠️ Position Repair Toolkit

#### Deep ITM Put Recovery
When a put is deeply underwater (>15% ITM):
1. Evaluate ratio roll (1 → 1.5 or 2 contracts at lower strikes)
2. Consider roll to further expiration (60-90 DTE) for more premium
3. Analyze assignment + CC vs continued rolling

#### Strike Adjustment Guidelines
- Roll down no more than 2% per week of time extension
- Accept assignment if roll credit < 0.5% of strike value
- Split large positions into multiple strikes during repair

#### Repair Evaluation Metrics
- Calculate breakeven time horizon for each approach
- Estimate opportunity cost vs. closing for loss
- Track repair efficiency in performance stats# True Wheel Strategy - Standard Operating Procedure

### ⚠️ TAX REALITY CHECK ⚠️
```
This strategy generates 90%+ SHORT-TERM capital gains
Your actual return = Strategy return × (1 - your tax rate)
Example: 15% return in 35% bracket = 9.75% kept
STRONGLY RECOMMENDED: Execute in IRA/Roth only
```

### 🎯 Objective
Own high-quality stocks at discounted entry points by selling cash-secured puts, generate additional income by writing covered calls, preserve capital with tight risk controls, and adapt to all market conditions for optimal risk-adjusted returns.

### 📊 Market Regime Adaptation

#### Hybrid Income/Growth Mode Selection
**Bull Market (SPY >50 & >200 MA, VIX <20)**
- Growth mode: More aggressive strikes (30-40 delta)
- Target higher premium stocks
- Accept more assignments

**Bear Market (SPY <50 & <200 MA, VIX >25)**
- Income mode: Conservative strikes (15-25 delta)
- Focus on dividend aristocrats
- Avoid assignment aggressively

**Neutral Market (Mixed signals)**
- Balanced approach: 25-30 delta
- Mix of growth and dividend stocks
- Neutral on assignment

### ✅ Core Principles

1. **Stock Owner First, Seller Second**
   - Only target stocks you'd happily hold through a downturn
   - Use options to improve basis - not to chase extra risk

2. **Assignment is Expected**
   - If you like the stock at the strike, assignment is a win
   - Covered calls milk premium while you hold

3. **Drawdown Hard Stop**
   - If total account equity drops **20%** from peak balance, stop new trades
   - Review all open positions, roll only if it improves basis and fits plan

### 📊 Entry Criteria

#### Position Entry Timing
**Best Days**: Tuesday-Thursday (avoid Monday gaps, Friday gamma)
**Best Times**: 
- 10:00-11:00 AM ET (post-opening volatility)
- 2:00-3:00 PM ET (afternoon stability)
**Avoid**: First/last 30 minutes, Fed days, major data releases

#### Stock Selection Requirements
**Liquidity Scoring (All required):**
- Minimum average daily volume: 1M+ shares
- Minimum option open interest: 500 contracts
- Maximum bid-ask spread: 5% of mid-price
- Options volume: 100+ contracts daily
- Liquidity Score: Volume × OI / Spread (higher = better)

**Volatility Filters:**
- IV Rank > 50% AND IV > 20% (both required)
- No trades within 7 days of earnings

**Valuation Anchor (Sector-Specific):**
- **Technology**: P/S < sector median or PEG < 1.5
- **Financials**: P/B < 1.5 or P/E < sector average
- **Industrials**: EV/EBITDA < 12
- **Consumer**: P/E < 20 or FCF yield > 5%
- **Healthcare**: Pipeline-adjusted P/E or P/S
- Only wheel if strike = fair value or discount

### 🔄 Trade Entry Rules

#### Cash-Secured Puts
- **Expiration Target: 30-45 DTE** (sweet spot: 35 DTE)
  - Prefer monthly expirations for liquidity
  - Never enter positions <21 DTE
  - Weeklies only for adjustments
- Target strikes based on market regime:
  - Bull: 30-40 delta (aggressive)
  - Neutral: 25-30 delta (balanced)
  - Bear: 15-25 delta (conservative)
- Position size per underlying: **Maximum 10% of total capital**
- Multiple strikes allowed: Max 2 per symbol, 5% apart
- Ladder in: Add new puts at lower strikes if thesis unchanged
- Minimum annualized premium: 20% return on capital

#### Fill Improvement Protocol
1. Always use limit orders
2. Start at mid-price
3. Adjust by $0.05 every 2 minutes
4. Maximum 3 adjustments (6 minutes)
5. Cancel if not filled - revisit later
6. For rolls: Accept up to 25% from mid

#### Capital Deployment Schedule
**New Capital Entry:**
- Split into 4 weekly tranches
- Deploy 25% per week over month
- Accelerate in high VIX (>30)
- Pause in extreme VIX (>50)

**Monthly Redeployment:**
- Premium collected stays in account
- Compounds into new positions
- Maintain 5% cash buffer minimum

#### Covered Calls (After Assignment)
- **Expiration Target: 30-45 DTE** (match put timeline)
- Wait for green day to sell (unless >3 days red)
- Pre-plan strikes during assignment week
- Strike selection based on cost basis and regime:
  - Bull market: 30-40 Delta (let them run)
  - Neutral: 20-30 Delta (balanced)
  - Bear market: 15-20 Delta (protect capital)
- For 200+ shares: Ladder strikes at multiple levels
- Use limit orders: Start at ask, work down

**Assignment Optimization:**
1. Track assignment probability starting at 7 DTE
2. If assignment likely (>80% ITM):
   - Pre-select covered call strikes
   - Set GTC orders for Monday after assignment
   - Target first green day premium
3. If avoiding assignment:
   - Roll at 2 DTE for credit only
   - Accept if no credit available

**Stop Loss on Shares:**
- Based on YOUR cost basis, not option P&L
- If shares drop >10% from your basis, evaluate:
  - Still believe in company? Keep selling calls
  - Thesis broken? Sell shares and move on
- Covered call P&L swings are normal - ignore them

### 🔁 Rolling Mechanics

#### Roll Matrix - Clear Rules

**Short Puts (Check in this order):**
1. **If Delta > 0.50** - Roll immediately (defensive)
2. **At 21 DTE** - Roll to next monthly cycle
3. **At >80% profit with >7 DTE** - Roll for efficiency
4. **Never roll for debit** - Take assignment instead
5. System prompt: "Roll or accept assignment?" - Confirm with fresh thesis

**Why roll profitable puts?**
- Holding last 20% for 10 days = poor use of capital
- Rolling to new position = fresh 100% premium potential
- Math: New position generates more $/day than holding

**Covered Calls:**
1. **Close at 50-70% profit** - Harvest gains early
2. **At <10 DTE** - Roll or let expire/assign
3. **If called away** - Bank profits, reassess for CSP entry

### 📋 Pre-Calculated Rolling Matrix

To remove decision fatigue, use this matrix:

#### CSP Rolling Guide
| Current Status | Action | Target |
|----------------|--------|--------|
| 21 DTE, OTM, <50% profit | Roll out | Same strike, next monthly |
| 21 DTE, OTM, >80% profit | Roll out+down | Lower strike, next monthly |
| Delta >0.50, any DTE | Roll out+down | Strike at 0.30 delta |
| 14 DTE, slightly ITM | Roll out+down | Strike at 0.25 delta |
| 7 DTE, deep ITM, want stock | Let assign | Prep CC strikes |
| 7 DTE, deep ITM, don't want | Roll aggressively | 0.20 delta, 45+ DTE |

#### CC Rolling Guide
| Current Status | Action | Target |
|----------------|--------|--------|
| 50% profit, >14 DTE | Close | Resell higher/later |
| 70% profit, any DTE | Close | Immediate resell |
| 21 DTE, OTM | Roll out | Same strike, next monthly |
| ITM, want to keep | Roll up+out | Strike above current price |
| Deep ITM, take profit | Let assign | Switch to CSP |

- May create liquidity opportunities

**M&A Activity:**

- Evaluate acquirer for new positions
- Cash deals = immediate exit

### 💰 Earnings Premium Harvesting

- No new positions 7 days before earnings
- Close or roll existing positions before earnings
- Exception: Defined risk spreads only (not part of core wheel)

#### Post-Earnings IV Crush Trade
**Day After Earnings:**
1. Check IV drop (must be >30% decline)
2. Verify no major guidance changes
3. Stock within 5% of pre-earnings price
4. Sell 30-45 DTE puts at 25-30 delta
5. Size at 50% of normal (uncertainty premium)

**Best Candidates**: Large caps with predictable earnings (AAPL, MSFT, JNJ)

### 🎯 Position & Sector Management

#### Sector Exposure Calculation
**Formula**: (All CSP strikes × 100 + Current share values) / Total potential exposure

**Dynamic Sector Limits (VIX-Adjusted):**
- VIX <20: Maximum 25% per sector
- VIX 20-30: Maximum 20% per sector
- VIX 30-40: Maximum 15% per sector
- VIX >40: Maximum 10% per sector
- Never >3 positions in same sector regardless of VIX

#### Multiple Strikes on Same Underlying
- Maximum 2 strikes on same symbol
- Strikes must be separated by at least 5%
- Combined exposure counts toward position limit
- Exception: Can have CSP + Shares + CC (full wheel)

### 💵 Monthly Income Targets

#### Income Target Calculation
**Base Formula:**
- Target monthly premium = Account value × Premium factor
- Premium factor varies by regime:
  - Bull Market: 1.5-2.0% monthly (18-24% annualized)
  - Neutral Market: 1.0-1.5% monthly (12-18% annualized)
  - Bear Market: 0.7-1.0% monthly (8-12% annualized)

**Example with $250K Account:**
- Bull market target: $3,750-$5,000/month
- Neutral market target: $2,500-$3,750/month
- Bear market target: $1,750-$2,500/month

#### Allocation Between Growth and Income
**Dynamic Allocation:**
- Income portion: Fixed monthly target
- Growth portion: Excess above income target

**Allocation Matrix by Market Regime:**
| Regime | Income % | Growth % | Cash % |
|--------|----------|----------|--------|
| Strong Bull | 40% | 55% | 5% |
| Mild Bull | 50% | 45% | 5% |
| Neutral | 60% | 30% | 10% |
| Mild Bear | 70% | 15% | 15% |
| Strong Bear | 80% | 0% | 20% |

#### Income Shortfall Protocol
If monthly target unlikely to be met:
1. Identify under-utilized capital
2. Evaluate using shorter DTE (carefully)
3. Consider slightly higher delta (within limits)
4. Accept lower month (never sacrifice safety)
5. Never sell options on earnings week to meet targets

#### Income Excess Protocol
If monthly target exceeded early:
1. Bank excess premiums as cash reserve
2. Reduce new position delta by 5-10 points
3. Extend DTE on new positions
4. Build reserve for future shortfall months

### 💰 Tax Loss Harvesting Protocol

#### Taxable Account Optimization
**Year-Round Harvesting:**
- Monthly tax loss review (15th of month)
- Identify underwater positions >30 days old
- Calculate tax benefit vs recovery potential
- Prioritize harvest for positions with thesis change

**Wash Sale Prevention Checklist:**

- Wait 31+ days before re-entering same position
- Track specific lots purchased

#### Strategic Year-End Moves
**October-December Timeline:**
- **October 1st**: Identify all YTD gains
- **November 1st**: Match potential losses against gains
- **December 1-15**: Execute final harvesting trades
- **December 16-31**: Avoid creating new wash sales

**December Triple-Check:**
1. No wash sales in December that carry to January
2. No deep ITM options that will trigger assignment
3. No uncovered short options through year-end

#### Assignment vs Sale Decision
When shares underwater:
- Calculate assignment vs sale tax implications
- Compare roll-for-credit potential vs tax benefit
- Consider qualified dividend holding impacts
- Factor in required recovery percentage

#### IRA/Roth Strategic Integration
**Tax-Advantaged Options:**
- Hold highest premium/highest turnover positions in IRA
- Use taxable for potential long-term holds
- Coordinate assignments across accounts
- Prioritize early profit-taking in taxable accounts

### 🗝️ Summary One-Pager

**The Wheel Works When You:**
- Pick stocks you want to own
- Sell puts at prices you like
- Take assignment without emotion
- Sell calls above your basis
- Respect position limits
- Honor stop losses (on underlying, not option P&L)
- Track performance honestly

### 📌 Stop Loss Examples

**CSP Example:**
- Sold TSLA $325 put for $5
- TSLA drops to $280 (14% below strike)
- Option shows -200% loss (normal!)
- Decision: Do I want TSLA at $325? NO → Close or roll
- This is real stop loss situation

**Wrong Thinking:**
- Sold AMD $135 put
- AMD at $133 (1.5% below strike)  
- Option shows -40% "loss"
- Don't panic! This is normal fluctuation
- Wait for 21 DTE to evaluate

**CC Example:**
- Own NVDA at $150 cost basis
- Stock now at $165, sold $170 call
- If NVDA drops to $135 (10% below YOUR basis) → Evaluate
- If call shows red P&L but stock above basis → Ignore

**The Wheel Fails When You:**
- Chase premium on junk
- Fight assignment with rolls
- Ignore risk limits
- Trade through earnings
- Forget about taxes
- Let emotions override rules
- **Add ANY complexity beyond CSP/CC**

### 📌 Final Rules

1. **Process > Profits** - Perfect execution matters more than P&L
2. **When in doubt, size down** - Live to trade another day
3. **Rules are non-negotiable** - No exceptions for "sure things"
4. **Review and adjust quarterly** - With data, not feelings
5. **NO STRATEGY ADDITIONS** - CSP and CC only, forever
6. **Maximum 3 decisions daily** - More = overtrading

*"Assignment is not failure - it's inventory. Keep risk tight, keep capital moving, and never chase what the chart won't give you."*
